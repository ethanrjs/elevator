Elevator Music for slow websites!

# Purpose
Have you ever found a website that loaded incredibly slowly, and with the 0.4 seconds of free time that you had during the wait you wish your brain was being stimulated by something else? Fear no more!
Elevator is an extremely intricate and complex extension designed to tend to your hyperactivity disorders with ease.

Simply install the firefox add-on and enjoy non-copyrighted elevator music with a potentially-licensed elevator ding!
