Elevator Music for slow websites!

# Purpose
Have you ever found a website that loaded incredibly slowly, and with the 0.4 seconds of free time that you had during the wait you wish your brain was being stimulated by something else? Fear no more!
Elevator is an extremely intricate and complex extension designed to tend to your hyperactivity disorders with ease.

Simply install the firefox add-on and enjoy non-copyrighted elevator music with a potentially-licensed elevator ding!

## Installation
Because this extension has not been verified or signed because I am lazy, do the following:
1. Navigate to about:debugging and click `This Firefox`
2. Click `Load Temporary Add-on...` ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79817320/220819471-7c486855-fce6-49ac-8eee-afcaaf2dc3fc.png)
3. Add the .zip and you're good to go!
